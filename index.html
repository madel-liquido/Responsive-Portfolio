            <h2 >About Me</h2>
            <p align="left"> Madel graduated from Saint Peter's University in 2019 with a Bachelors of Science degree in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science. While at university, Madel worked as an undergraduate Mathematics tutor, supplemental instructor for differential and integral calculus, 
               senior year experience career advisor, and research fellow in computational neuroscience, a strain of mathematical biology. 
               Her research focused primarily on developing a mathematical model to explain the role of patterned neural input on a rhythmic oscillatory network with applications in spinal injuries related to paralysis. 
               She has given talks on her research at MathFest 2017 and the Joint Mathematics Meeting 2018. 
               <br>
               <br>
               Currently, Madel works full-time at one of Wall Street's bulge bracket investment banks in the quant and technology space as a value at risk modeler covering securitized products. Day to day responsibilities include model construction, time series analysis, and production issue resolvement. 
               <br>
               <br>
               Madel is also currently pursuing ongoing studies part-time at the Rutgers Full Stack Development Coding Bootcamp with aspirations of one day becoming a full stack developer.
               <br>
               <br>
               Her motivations for studying full stack development derive from her quantitative interests and love of creative innovation.
               She endorses education and learning as a constant component throughout life.            
               <br>
               <br>
               "Emerson once said that 'life is a journey, not a destination.' I apply the same ideology to learning. I do not believe there is any point in our lives where we can say that we have learned all there is to know about any particular topic or field.
               The beauty of learning is in its nonexistant limits &mdash; with access to the right material, anyone can learn anything and no one is ever too young or too old to start that journey."           
               <br>
               <br>
               In her free time, Madel enjoys eating all kinds of food, taking spontaneous naps, drawing, and cycling.
